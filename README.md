# Wage Analysis and Prediction

The report is made for the group assignment for USYD's unit- QBUS2810.

Past relevant studies have confirmed both education level and work experience are important indicators of peopleâ€™s wage level. The US Department of Education and US Department of Labor are interested in the effect of schooling on subsequent earnings of individuals. They also wish to build a model that can accurately predict income of individuals so that they can better understand the determinants of job market outcomes. Your group has been commissioned to analyse the data provided and then report back to the two Departments.

There are two primary goals that the two Departments would like your group to focus on:

(a) Causal model for education vs vocation: to understand the relationship between years of education vs experience and monthly wages and to estimate the return to additional year of education in presence of an alternative in the form of an available professional career path.

(b) Predictive goal: to develop an optimal model for predicting the wages of individuals.
